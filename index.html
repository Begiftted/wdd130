        <p> I am a UI/UX Designer with a
            background in photography. My background in photography has allowed me to develop a keen
            eye for detail, composition, and color, which I bring to my design work.

            I believe that design is not just about aesthetics; it's about creating experiences that are intuitive,
            functional, and beautiful. My goal as a designer is to create designs that not only look great but also
            provide a seamless
            user experience.

            I have worked on a variety of projects, from web design and mobile app design to branding and visual
            identity.My experience in photography has helped me to understand the importance of storytelling, which I
            bring to my
            designwork.

            I strive to create designs that tell a story and evoke an emotional response from the user.

            I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies, and I am always
            looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Over the years I have worked across several
            industries and sectors ranging from tourism, government,
            startups,and education.
