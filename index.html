            <p>I am a UI/UX Designer with a background in photography. My background in photography has allowed me
                to develop a keeneye for detail, composition, and color, which I bring to my design work.

        <p>Rivers State, located in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region, is known as the “Treasure Base of the Nation” for its

            and gas resources. Its capital, Port Harcourt, is a major industrial and commercial hub. The state is also
            blessed with
            diverse cultures, vibrant festivals, fertile lands, and an extensive network of rivers and creeks that shape
            its economy
